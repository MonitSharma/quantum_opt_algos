## Introduction

Combinatorial optimization problems arise in many domains, including finance, logistics, and scheduling. Traditional optimization methods struggle to efficiently handle these problems as their size increases. Quantum optimization algorithms, such as QAOA and VQE, leverage quantum mechanics to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. This repository provides implementations of several quantum algorithms and their variants, along with benchmarking and performance evaluations.

## Implemented Algorithms

The repository includes implementations of the following quantum optimization algorithms:

- **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** – A variational algorithm for solving combinatorial problems by encoding them into quantum Hamiltonians.
- **Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO)** – A qubit-efficient approach designed to reduce hardware requirements while maintaining solution quality.
- **Warm Start QAOA** – An improved QAOA method that initializes parameters using classical solutions to enhance convergence.
- **Multi-Angle QAOA (MA-QAOA)** – A variant of QAOA that introduces multiple parameters per layer for improved performance.
- **Conditional Value-at-Risk QAOA (CVaR QAOA)** – A risk-aware modification of QAOA that focuses on optimizing the best subset of measurement outcomes.
- **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** – A hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that minimizes the expectation value of a problem Hamiltonian.
- **Conditional Value-at-Risk VQE (CVaR VQE)** – A refinement of VQE that prioritizes high-quality solutions by filtering measurement results.
- **Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE)** – A qubit-efficient encoding method that incorporates classical post-processing, such as bit swap search, to refine solutions.
